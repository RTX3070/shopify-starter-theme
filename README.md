# Shopify Starter Theme

A backbone theme for Shopify Online Store 2.0 upon which build your next Shopify Store. 

## How to:
---

1. Install Shopify CLI - see here for more [information](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli/installation)

2. Login into your Shopify Store:
`shopify login --store [STORE ADDRESS]`

3. Run the following command to clone "Shopify Starter Theme" into your local machine:
